# appliedDB_project

This project was created by Grant Kveton during undergraduate studies at Florida Atlantic University in 2019.

## Concept

The goal of this project was to implement a login and character creation system that might be used in an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game. The game engine used is Unity. The backend consists of SQL database with PHP code handling backend communication and database transactions.

MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) video games are a popular style of video game in today’s culture and can often have hundreds of thousands to even millions of concurrent players. Data needs to be managed and updated efficiently and concurrently. A MySQL database system is suited for a small MMO, but for larger MMO player bases, developers must be very clever to implement a system that can handle so many concurrent data transactions. An important question that must be asked is, “What data to store locally vs. on server?”.
